## Computer Vision: Advanced Lane Finding

### Overview

The objective of this project is to identify lane lines using traditional computer vision techniques. In order to achieve this, we have designed a computer vision pipeline as depicted below.

The input of our pipeline would be images or video clips. Input images or videos will go through various pipeline stages (will be discussed in the latter part of this document) and produce annotated video and images as given below.

Next, we are going to describe our pipeline stages starting from the Camera Calibrator. The sample input and output of the Camera Calibrator pipeline stage is given below.

### Camera Calibrator

Camera calibration logic is encapsulated in **`CameraCalibrator`** class in the **`advanced_lane_finding.py`** module. This class's constructor takes following arguments.

1. A list of camera images which we are going to use for camera calibration. (Usually, we use chessboard images)
2. Number of corners in X direction
3. Number of corners in Y direction
4. A boolean flag, if it is True, we do camera calibration and store those calibration data. 

The public method of this **`CameraCalibrator`** class is **`undistort`** and it takes a distorted image as the input and produces an undistorted image.

### Warp Transformer

The second step of the lane line finding pipeline is "perspective transformation" step. In computer vision,  an image perspective is a phenomenon where objects appear smaller the further away they are from a viewpoint.   

A perspective transform maps the points in a given image to different, desired, image points with a new perspective. In the project we are going to use birdâ€™s-eye view transform that allows us to view a lane from above; this will be useful for calculating the lane curvature in step 4.

Warped operation is encapsulated in **`PerspectiveTransformer`** class of the **`advanced_lane_finding.py`** package located in **`$PROJECT_HOME/src`** folder. In order to create an instance of **`PerspectiveTransformer`**  class, we need to provide four source and destination points. In order to clearly visible lane lines, we have selected following source and destination points. 

|Source Points | Destination Points|
|--------------|-------------------|
|(253, 697)      |    (303, 697)       |
|(585, 456)      |(303, 0)             |
|(700, 456)      |(1011, 0)            |
|(1061, 690)     |(1011, 690)          |


I verified the performance of my perspective transformation by transforming an image (**`../output_images/undistorted_test_images/straight_lines2.jpg`**) using above source and destination points as given below.

In this project, your goal is to write a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video, but the main output or product we want you to create is a detailed writeup of the project.  Check out the [writeup template](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines/blob/master/writeup_template.md) for this project and use it as a starting point for creating your own writeup.  

Creating a great writeup:
---
A great writeup should include the rubric points as well as your description of how you addressed each point.  You should include a detailed description of the code used in each step (with line-number references and code snippets where necessary), and links to other supporting documents or external references.  You should include images in your writeup to demonstrate how your code works with examples.  

All that said, please be concise!  We're not looking for you to write a book here, just a brief description of how you passed each rubric point, and references to the relevant code :). 

You're not required to use markdown for your writeup.  If you use another method please just submit a pdf of your writeup.

The Project
---

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

The images for camera calibration are stored in the folder called `camera_cal`.  The images in `test_images` are for testing your pipeline on single frames.  To help the reviewer examine your work, please save examples of the output from each stage of your pipeline in the folder called `ouput_images`, and include a description in your writeup for the project of what each image shows.    The video called `project_video.mp4` is the video your pipeline should work well on.  

The `challenge_video.mp4` video is an extra (and optional) challenge for you if you want to test your pipeline under somewhat trickier conditions.  The `harder_challenge.mp4` video is another optional challenge and is brutal!

If you're feeling ambitious (again, totally optional though), don't stop there!  We encourage you to go out and take video of your own, calibrate your camera and show us how you would implement this project from scratch!
